sets  :: A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed elements

union: we must take all the elements from both the sets combined in a single set is None:

Intersection : we must take common elements from both the sets ,placing as single set

Minus        : s1 - s2  => {1,2} eliminates common elements of s2 from s1
