'''Number system
Number System is a method of representing Numbers on the Number Line with the help of a set of Symbols and rules.
These symbols range from 0-9 and are termed as digits
#Natural numbers:Natural numbers are the numbers that are used for counting and are a part of real numbers.
The set of natural numbers include only the positive integers
1,2,3,4,5............
#Whole Number:Whole numbers are a set of numbers including all positive integers and 0.
Whole numbers are a part of real numbers that do not include fractions, decimals
0,1,2,3,4,5......
Whole number has even,odd,prime,composite
1.Even number:Numbers that are easily divisible by 2 leaving the remainder 0 behind are termed as even numbers.
For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on.
2.Odd number:In math, all the numbers that are not the multiples of 2 are odd numbers.
For example, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
3.Prime number:In math, all the numbers that are not the multiples of 2 are odd numbers.
 For example, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
 prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
 A factor is a whole number that can be divided evenly into another
4.Composite number:All the even numbers which are not prime are even composite numbers. For example, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, are even composite numbers. Consider the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 again.
Here 4, 10, and 12 are the even composites because they have even divisors and satisfy the composite condition

Integer:
An integer is a number with no decimal or fractional part from the set of negative and positive numbers,
including zero. Examples of integers are: -5, 0, 1, 5, 8, 97, and 3,043..

Rational Number:
In Maths, a rational number is a type of real numbers, which is in the form of p/q where q is not equal to zero.
Any fraction with non-zero denominators is ...2/3, 3/5 --> 0.6, -2/7

Irrational Number:
An irrational number is a type of real number which cannot be represented as a simple fraction.
It cannot be expressed in the form of a ratio. If N is irrational, then N is not equal to p/q where p and q are integers and q is not equal to 0.
Example: √2, √3, √5, √11, √21, π(Pi) are all irrational.

Real Number:
Real numbers include rational numbers like positive and negative integers, fractions, and irrational numbers
This indicates that real numbers include natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers.
For example, 3, 0, 1.5, 3/2, √5, and so on are real numbers.

Imaginary Number:
An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property i2 = −1
For example, 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is −25. By definition, zero is considered to be both real and imaginary.
