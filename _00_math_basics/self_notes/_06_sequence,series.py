'''
sequence : A sequence is a positionally ordered collection of items

Infinite Sequence : 1,2,3,4,5.......n      a sequence of natural numbers
  sum of natural numbers :n(n+1)/2

Finite Sequence   : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,....1000    a sequence of numbers for required limit

Backward Sequence : 5,4,3,2,1          a sequence of numbers in reverse order

Alphabetical seq  : a,b,c,d,e...z       a sequence of alphabets in order

Negative seq      : -1,-2,-3,-4,-5,....
                     : ......-5,-4,-3,-2,-1       a sequence of negative numbers in normal or reverse order

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60....10000      finite sequence of numbers which are multiple of 10's
2,4,6,8,10,12,14.......         infinite sequence of numbers which are multiple of 2
   1,2,4,8,16,32..........  infinite sequence of numbers multiplying 2 from initial 1 and the result with 2
   1,39,27,81.............  infinite sequence of random numbers

    Series : a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type

     2
     âˆ‘   5r
    r=1

5(1) + 5(2) = 15  => resultant
