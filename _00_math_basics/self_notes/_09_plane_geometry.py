 PLOYGON IS 2D figure made of straight lines.
  example == traingles,polygons

   TRAINGLE : Its a polygon having 0nly 3 sides and 3 angles and these 3 angles together 180 degrees
            types : Equilateral    =     3 sides , 3 equal angles always 60 degrees -
         Isosceles          =              2 equal sides, 2 equal angles
        Scalene          =                  no equal sides and equal angles
        acute angle traingle = all 3 angles are less than 60 degrees
        Right A Triangle = its atriangle having right angle 90 dgrees
     Obtuse Triangle = one of interior angles will be more than 90 degrees

QUADRILATERAL :  It has 4 sides , 2D shape, closed and having straight sides

               -Parallelogram =A parallelogram has opposite sides parallel and equal in length. Also opposite angles are equal

                 - Square =A square has equal sides and every angle is a right angle (90°)
                            Also opposite sides are parallel

                    - Rectangle=A rectangle is a four-sided shape where every angle is a right angle (90°).
                                 Also opposite sides are parallel and of equal length

                     - Rhombus=A rhombus is a four-sided shape where all sides have equal length.
                                Also opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal

                 - Trapezium= A trapezium  has a pair of opposite sides parallel

PENTAGON   : a polygon having 5 sides
HEXAGON  :  a polygon having 6 sides
