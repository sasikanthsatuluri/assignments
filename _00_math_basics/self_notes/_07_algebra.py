expression : An expression is a number, a variable,
             or a combination of numbers, variables and operation symbols.
             Ex: 7.8 + 5
                 2y + 3

Equation   : Equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign.
             Ex: 11 - 1 = 10
                 x + 5  = 40
                 3a + 4 = 5a + 14
                 L.H.S  = R.H.S


Numeric expression   : It will contain all numbers.
                       To apply operations to numbers we can use this
                       Ex: 4(1+ 1)
                           = 8
Algebraic expression : At least one variable and at least one operation
                       Ex: 2(p + 8q)

simplifying an algebraic  expression
          3(4p+5q) -2(5p_6q) , where p = 2 , q = 3
          12p +15q -10p+12q
          2p +27q    ===>  2(2) +27(3)
                         ==> 4 + 81 =85

        proving                  (a-b)² = a² -2ab+b²
          (a-b)²  = (a-b)(a-b)
                    a(a-b)-b(a-b)
                    a² -ab -ab+b² ==> a² -2ab +b²
